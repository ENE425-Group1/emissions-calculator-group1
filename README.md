# Emissions Calculator Group 1
## Hello and welcome!
#### This is group 1's project diary. As part of ENE425 Sustainable Energy's assessment, students are tasked with developing a *software application* to work out the transport carbon emissions of each group. The objective of the app is to explore how technology, public policy and our own personal decisions could contribute towards mitigating carbon emissions. This section is meant to be kept up to date so that everyone is able to follow the project as it progresses.

## Methodology research
#### This section is for research on relevant methods for calculating emissions from transportation. When adding to this section, include a short description of the methodology and referances to the source material and other relevant research (*URL links*), as shown in the example below: 
 
#### Descriptive title (Emission factors for diesel cars), source (IEA)
This a short description of the findings of the research, and the methodology IEA has used to calculate the emission factors. The method is based on such and such research, and uses this and that data. The methodology is further described on this page: *URL link*. 

The IEA is a valid source on this issue due to some arguments. The research is similiar to several other sources on the issue, such as this research (*URL*) and this research (*URL*). On the other hand, there are also other findings with different results, such as the method used by "some statistic group" (*URL*), which gives lower emission factors. The majority of research, however, supports the described research. 


## Weekly progress

#### Week 5 - Task 1: 
The coding environment here in GitHub was created. 
#### Week 6 - Task 2: 
We have uploaded files from a repository to our repository, and read a directory tree from other developers. 
#### Week 7 - Task 3: 
(Diary Group week 7, fill in here what we have done during the week. Follow the task 3 description
