# Emissions Calculator Group 1
## Hello and welcome!
#### This is group 1's project diary. As part of ENE425 Sustainable Energy's assessment, students are tasked with developing a *software application* to work out the transport carbon emissions of each group. The objective of the app is to explore how technology, public policy and our own personal decisions could contribute towards mitigating carbon emissions. This section is meant to be kept up to date so that everyone is able to follow the project as it progresses.

##Week 5 - Task 1:
